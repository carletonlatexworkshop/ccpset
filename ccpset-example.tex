\section*{Chapter 4}

% The pset environment creates a list and configures the
% \problem{} and \exercise{} commands.
% All your problems should be inside a pset environment, but
% you can have more than one if you need to.
\begin{pset}
  % And here's where the fun begins.
  % For each problem, use a \problem{} command, with the problem number
  % as an argument. (You can also use the \exercise{} command, which just
  % uses the word "Exercise" instead of "Problem".)
  \problem{2(a)}
  % If you want to include the problem statement, you can do so using the
  % statement environment.
  \begin{statement}
    Prove that there are infinitely many primes numbers.
  \end{statement}
  % The proof environment can be used to format solutions that are proofs.
  % This example also demonstrates the use of inline math.
  \begin{proof}
    Suppose that $\mathbf{p} = \cbrac{p_{1}, p_{2}, \dots, p_{n}}$ is a finite set of primes.
    Then $1 + \prod_{i = 1}^{n} p_{i} = 1 + p_{1} p_{2} \cdots p_{n}$ is not divisible by any $p_{i}$, so there is a prime not in $\mathbf{p}$.
    Thus, no finite set contains all primes.
  \end{proof}

  % If you don't want to type up the problem statement, you can just dive right in!
  \problem{17.2}
  It follows from Theorem 2.7.14-a that
  % Here, we'll use an align* environment to set several equations without numbers.
  \begin{align*}
  \sin A \cos B &= \frac{1}{2} \pbrac*{\sin \pbrac*{A-B} + \sin \pbrac*{A+B}}, \\
  \sin A \sin B &= \frac{1}{2} \pbrac*{\sin \pbrac*{A-B} + \cos \pbrac*{A+B}}, \\
  \intertext{and finally that} % The \intertext{} command inserts paragraph text into multiline display math
  \cos A \cos B &= \frac{1}{2} \pbrac*{\cos \pbrac*{A-B} + \cos \pbrac*{A+B}}.
\end{align*}
\end{pset}

\section*{Worksheet 4}
% If you start a new section, it needs to be *outside* the pset environment,
% due to complications with the way LaTeX handles lists.
\begin{pset}
  \exercise{19}
  We can conclude the following:
  % The theorem-like environments all work in problem sets, in case you need them.
  \begin{theorem*}
    There are $2^{\binom{n}{2}}$ labeled graphs on $n$ vertices.
  \end{theorem*}

  % Here, we put LaTeX's table features to use.
